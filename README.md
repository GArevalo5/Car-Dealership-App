# Car-Dealership-App
A workshop to make a console-based dealership application with straightforward features.

First started off white boarding what classes I needed and where to start. Made the project itself afterwards and created the classes UserInterface, DealersFileManger,Vehicle,Dealership and program. I also added the csv file I would need into the project.

Realized I started working on the wrong class first. That being the DealersFileManger and moved to the Dealship class and vehicle class.
The vehicle class is filled with variables, getters and setters to make well a vehicle(see screenshot below).

The Dealship class at the moment is currently the same as the vehicle class where it's variables, getters and setters. This class is more to make a object for the dealership (see screenshot below).

After setting up both classes I went back to work on the dealshipfilemanger which gets all the information from the csv and puts it into a arraylist (see screenshot below).

I then moved on to set up the main screen that the user when see when first activating the application and setting up the options. Application now runs ,but only goes back to the main screen or exits out of the application.
